    "# Wrangles report\n",
    "\n",
    "### The wrangle has been made on the We Rate Dog dataset and is composed of three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Data gathering\n",
    "#### - Data assessement\n",
    "#### - Data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data gathering\n",
    "\n",
    "I will describe brievely each of these three steps to help you understand what I did.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the data gathering part, I get the data from Twitter by Udacity beacause I didn't sucess to create a devopper account. So I had this dataset of twitter that I called 'tweet-json.txt'. the document was a text write in the Json fromat so traducted It with json library and transformed the array in a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I had this prediction dataset in the tsv format wich is tab separated value. I transformed by changing the separator in the pandas function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tweet dataset was already from a csv format so I didn't have to do anything apart from loading It.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "I looked into each dataset to measure the work to do and I set up a list of programation task to accomplish in order to get a much more clean dataset.\n",
    "The most of the work was in the dataset from the API:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quality issues\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Drop unecessary column\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) 'source' column should only contain the social media's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) No name for some dogs ('a'or 'None' value).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) Type of Timestamp columns, should be time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5) dog_type, source should be categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6) Wrong numerators and denominators (outliers must be deleted and denominator set to 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "and there were a little bit to do in the predictions dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Drop unecessary columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) change the variable type (dog types are categorical variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tidiness issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter_dogs dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Columns 'doggo','floofer','pupper','puppo' are not variables and should represent just one column called 'dog_type'\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Type of Timestamp columns, should be time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) dog_type, source should be categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) Need a new columns for rating_numerator/rating_denominator\n",
    "\n",
    "After that I had to compute those steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the work is just finding the right function to do It, like for deleting unecessary columns or to set the 'timestamp' column to a dtatetime and set 'dog_type' (a futur column) and 'source' has categorical variables.\n",
    "Notice that I dropped in both dataset the urls or jpg columns beacause It was useless for my analysis. I just keeped 'source' because I could deduce the social media name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 'source' column I could have used a regex method to find the social media but here I just had 4 choices so I did a function with four 'if' statements. In a more complicated case with others link I would had to find a regex function and make It work.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 'name' column many dog names doesn't exist so I just deleted them because I foud It strange to not find their names. Maybe I could have set those values to NaN. In both choices It was a minor part of the dataset so It didn't impact It I guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Denominator and numerator had quality issues. I just set the values to 10 for the denominator and for the numerator I assigned the mean of all good numerator in order to keep the datas because many had this poblem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Tidiness issue the most complicated part was to replace the four dogs columns to one. I didn't use the merge function and I set manually this column.\n"
