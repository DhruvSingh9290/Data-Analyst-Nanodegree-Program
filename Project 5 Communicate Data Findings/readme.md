# Ford GoBike analysis
## by Bertrand


## Dataset

> This dataset is a dataset provided by Ford. Those datas are those from their GoBike application, an application which resgistered trips of users. In the Dataset we have the user id, the trip duration, the start hour of the trip, the distance and the localisation of the start station or the end station.


## Summary of Findings

> The user type is in majority subscriber for 400 000 peoples and for 100 000 peoples It's customer.

>The trip duration mean is very close to 1000 sec and the histogramme confirm It. So the vast majority of trips are around 15mn and a very few proportion of trips exced 4000 sec.

>The start hour is more around 8am where people go to work and around 4-5pm. The end hour is pretty close because most of the trips are arounds 15mn so we should the same histogramme.

> The start and end station are in three positions on a 2D scatterplot, we could show this three positions on a map.

>The three positions used by this application are in San Fransisco, San josé and Oakland.

>Customer tends to have much longer traject (around 2800 sec) while the Subscribers are around 800 sec. There is a huge difference between those two.

>And in the three positions Oakland is the start station by wich start the longer trajects (3200 sec). Then follow san fransisco with 2900 sec and then San josé (2000 sec).

## Key Insights for Presentation
> I use univariate plot to understand the spread of each variable like the duration.
> I plotted the three main positions on a map using the kepler web tool. I use multivariate plot to show differences between the peoples of the three positions.
